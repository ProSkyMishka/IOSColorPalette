# IOSColorPalette

What issues prevent us from using storyboards in real projects?

1. It can be time consuming
2. Can be restrictive
3. It doesn't always look good
4. if we have a lot of Controllers we can accidentally change something in one of them and miss it

What does the code on lines 25 and 29 do?
